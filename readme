code for 1st gen research web application researchpages. No longer in development, previously active at http://researchpages.net/. Built in python on an old version of djago. Feel free to make use of this code, but please attribute it to me. Contact me with questions but it's so long since I looked at this code there's no guarantee I'll be able to help.
