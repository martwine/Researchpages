code for 1st gen research web application researchpages. No longer in development, but still active at http://researchpages.net/. Built in python on an old version of djago. Feel free to make use of this code, but please attribute it to me. Contact me with questions but it's so long since I looked at this code there's no guarantee I'll be able to help. 

If anyone would like to develop for the researchpages site, then I'm more than happy to let you do so - please contact me for access to the site code and svn repository.
